# CineScreen TV App

CineScreen is a TV application for browsing and watching movies. It allows users to view movie details, watch movie trailers, and enjoy a user-friendly interface designed using Jetpack Compose. The app follows a clean architecture with modularization, pagination, and dependency injection using Dagger Hilt. It also integrates with a REST API using Retrofit to fetch movie data.

## Features

- Browse a collection of movies
- View detailed information about each movie
- Watch movie trailers
- User-friendly UI with TV components and carousel views

## Architecture

CineScreen follows a clean architecture pattern, allowing for clear separation of concerns and easy maintainability. The project is modularized for improved scalability, and Dagger Hilt is used for dependency injection.

## Modules

The app follows a modular architecture, dividing functionality into the following modules:

- **app**: Main entry point, UI, and presentation logic. This module also handles dependency injection.
- **common**: Contains shared components, domain logic, and data handling used across different features.
- **feature-home**: Module for the home screen feature, including UI, presentation logic, and data handling specific to this feature.
- **feature-details**: Module for the movie details screen feature, including UI, presentation logic, and data handling specific to this feature.
- **feature-search**: Module for the search screen feature, including UI, presentation logic, and data handling specific to this feature.

Each module is designed to encapsulate specific functionality, promoting a clean and organized codebase. The `app` module serves as the main entry point, orchestrating the various features and handling dependency injection.
